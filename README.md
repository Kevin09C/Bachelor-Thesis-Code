# ML-Project-Code

Read training notes text file to get an idea of how we train and test. 
Take a look at RunCustomLeNet.py, train_model.py, and unsharpmask.py to observe the programs used to test the model, train the model, and preprocess the images. Inside these programs there are given instruction on how to execute each of them. Also, go to models->nn->conv->customLenet.py to observe how the model is built.
